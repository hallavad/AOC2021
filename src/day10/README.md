## Notes

I'm not happy with the time it took me to finish todays challenge. It took longer than I would have liked considering it's not that hard of a problem to solve. However sometimes you miss small things and have a hard time figuring out why, especally since I'm learning typescript along the way. Trying to be fast and learning a new language is not the greatest combination.

The final solution however is something I'm happy with. It utilises much of the same code for both parts with the difference that part 2 gives 0 points to corrupted rows while part 1 gives 0 points to incomplete rows.
