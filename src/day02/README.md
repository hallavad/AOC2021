## Notes

Today i did not forget to parse my input from string to int where neccessary so it went a little bit faster. I can also tell that I'm not 100% familiar with javascript for these kinds of problems but I will get more comfortable with typescript (mostly javascript) the further I get in to this. Which is good since my goal is to get comfortable to use typescript over javascript in most situations.

For the solution in general I'm happy about how i managed to use a reduce in order to parse through the list. It also worked out nicely for part 2 which was mostly a copy-paste with minor changes.
