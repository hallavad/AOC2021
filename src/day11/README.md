## Notes

I started by writing functions for the different logical part today instead of doing most of the work in the part1 function and moving it to separate functions when doing part 2. Which meant part 1 took a little longer but part 2 went much faster. Something I should be better at doing, however it's also a bit of a slippery slope since you can separate the logic in too many functions if you're not carefully. 

For the solution I'm happy except for the neighbour checking which has a lot of if statements. There should be a better way to do that so that I can either hide those checks or do less checks, making the code more readable. I'm also thinking about creating a class for the solution and utilising methods to make it easier to follow the logic.
