## Notes

The difficulty bump between part 1 and part 2 was quite substantial today. However some logic or understanding of the problem were transferable. I could reuse the understanding that some numbers were the only one to have a certain length. For the others I had to come up with a way of sorting them out without the length. My solution works but is not the most efficient since it checks if an input contains all the wires of a previous input to determine which input the current one could be. This could probably be solved more efficiently with a proper parser which I'm tempted to write (but I will probably not have the time).
