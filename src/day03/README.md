## Notes

My key take away from today is to better utilise the given test cases. I had a small bug in part1 that took a while to resolve, since i didn't use the given test case. For part2 i had a few bugs some because of copy-pasteing the for loop (which i didn't realize at first). Which i managed to resolve by utilizing the much smaller test case that let me analyze where it went wrong.
