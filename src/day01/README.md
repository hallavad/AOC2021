## Notes

Took longer than i thought, because of one simple error that took me longer realise than it should've. The test case provided ran fine and wasn't affected. I had forgot to parse the rawinput into ints for the comparison which threw of the count by 1 in part 1. And got very apparent trying to print the sum of the sliding windows in part 2. However figured it out eventually.
